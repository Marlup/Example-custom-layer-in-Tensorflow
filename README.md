# Regression with TensorFlow. Custom Adaptive Activation Layer

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates a simple regression task using Tensorflow. Two different models are compared: a standard Fully Connected Neural Network (FCN) and an FCN with a custom activation function called "Adaptive Activation." The models are trained and evaluated using TensorFlow.

## Usage

To use the Adaptive Activation Layer in your own projects, you can simply copy and paste the code provided above into your TensorFlow codebase. You can then create instances of the AdaptiveActivation layer within your neural network architectures.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

+ tensorFlow
+ keras
+ scikit-learn
+ jupyter Notebook
+ matplotlib
+ pandas

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras scikit-learn matplotlib pandas jupyter
```
